## My Process
### Built with

- React.js
- HTML / CSS / ES6

# What I Have Used
- For the backend server environment, I used Node.js with Express.js framework to design application layer.
- For the persistence of data, I used MongoDB as my database to store user's notes.
- A note schema holds title and content fields.
- For the frontend i used React.js library to design the client side of the application.
- React hooks especially useState, useEffect and useRef are used to increase effectiveness of the application through maintaining(useState), refreshing(useEffect) and reassigning(useRef) amongst component states.
- For deploying the app to Heroku, I followed this article.
